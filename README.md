A tool to convert and import SynthRiders custom format into AudioTrip

This tool aims to provide an easy to use way to import existing SynthRiders custom songs into AudioTrip.

## outlook
It is planned to provide a way of converting songs from AudioTrip into SynthRiders. However, since I do not currently own SynthRiders, testing any conversion is not possible.
If there is a developer that is up to the task, contact me via discord (see profile information). 

## Installation
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Blogshot/trip-sitter/releases) and install.

## Usage
You can easily Drag'n'Drop a `.synth`-file into the app to make it available in AudioTrip.

## Limitations
* Gems might be inaccurately placed or out of reach
* Barrier placement might end combos when there is no time to evade them
