# Disclaimer
In order to prevent rumors or "bad blood" happening I want to make sure to point out some things.

* Because of the different gameplay elements of each game, this tool is unable to create identical conversions. Each conversion usually contains sections where reworking is needed to provide a fluent and fun experience. 
* Every custom song that is created using this tool is expected to be edited and become an individual piece of work.
* This project is not affiliated with AudioTrip, SynthRiders, their respective communities or any other third party, especially any modding community.
* AudioTrip's and SynthRiders' file formats are readable plain text. This tool is not breaking any sort of protective measures.
* If you feel the need to share your concerns about this project, feel free to contact me via Discord. (see profile information)

# TripSitter
This tool aims to provide an easy to use way to import existing AudioTrip/SynthRiders custom songs into AudioTrip/SynthRiders.

## Installation
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Blogshot/trip-sitter/releases) and install.

## Usage
SynthRiders -> AudioTrip: Drag'n'Drop a `.synth`-file into the app to make it available in AudioTrip.
AudioTrip -> SynthRiders: Drag'n'Drop a `.ats`-file into the app to make it available in SynthRiders. (not yet supported; not in active development)

## Limitations
* Elements/Gems might be inaccurately timed or difficult to reach in-game
* AudioTrip doesn't support center barriers; they are omitted
* The diagonal barriers of AudioTrip and SynthRiders are angled differently; this *will* affect movements
