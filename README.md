# Disclaimer
* Although this tool currently only supports SR -> AT conversions, AT -> SR is in active development.
* This tool is not able (or meant) to just Copy-Paste songs of one game to another. Each converted file usually contains multiple sections where reworking is needed to provide a fluent and fun experience. This is a logical consequence of the different gameplay elements of each game.
* Because of this, every custom song that is created based off a conversion is expected to be an individual piece of work, which is encouraged by both communities.
* This project is not affiliated with AudioTrip, SynthRiders, their respective communities or any other third party, especially any modding community.
* If you feel the need to share your concerns about this project, feel free to directly contact me via Discord. (see profile information)

# TripSitter
This tool aims to provide an easy to use way to import existing AudioTrip/SynthRiders custom songs into AudioTrip/SynthRiders.

## Installation
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Blogshot/trip-sitter/releases) and install.

## Usage
SynthRiders -> AudioTrip: Drag'n'Drop a `.synth`-file into the app to make it available in AudioTrip.
AudioTrip -> SynthRiders: Drag'n'Drop a `.ats`-file into the app to make it available in SynthRiders. (not yet supported; in active development)

## Limitations
* Events might be inaccurately placed or completely out of reach
* AudioTrip doesn't support center barriers; they are omitted
* The diagonal barriers of AudioTrip and SynthRiders are angled differently, which might affect flow
