A tool to convert and import SynthRiders custom format into AudioTrip

This tool aims to provide an easy to use way to import existing SynthRiders custom songs into AudioTrip.

## Installation
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Blogshot/trip-sitter/releases) and install.

## Usage
You can easily Drag'n'Drop a `.synth`-file into the app to make it available in AudioTrip.

## Limitations
There are two possible formats of `.synth`-Files, which use different mechanisms to represent the placements of events. This tool is currently able to import the *newer* of the two formats, which should support the majority of songs.
